# Active Flutter Suppression

### Problem Statement
"Aircraft wings are susceptible to flutter, a potentially catastrophic aeroelastic instability where aerodynamic forces couple with structural dynamics, leading to self-sustaining oscillations that 
can exceed safe structural limits at high speeds. Traditional passive methods, such as stiffening structures or adding mass, increase weight and reduce fuel efficiency, while existing active suppression 
systems are complex and costly to implement. The challenge is to develop a simplified, simulation-based active flutter suppression system that uses real-time feedback control to dampen wing oscillations effectively, 
ensuring stability across a range of airspeeds while minimizing additional weight and complexity. This project aims to address the need for an accessible, lightweight solution to enhance aircraft safety and 
performance."
